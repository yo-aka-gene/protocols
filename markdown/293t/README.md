## Materials
### 293T medium
| name | dose | ratio |
| :---: | ---: | :---: |
| DMEM | 500 mL | - |
| FBS | 50 mL | 1:10 |
| p/s | 5 mL | 1:100 |

## Methods
### Culture (from stock)
- defrost 293T cell stock in 37°C water bath
- PBS wash x1
    - centrifuge 1200 rpm x5min
    - aspiration
- ressuspend with 10 mL 293T medium and apply into T25
- after confirmation with a microscope, transfer to the incubator
- culture for 5 days (approx.)

### Passage
- pipetting for several times to dettach cells from T25
- apply all to 15mL tube
- centrifuge 1200rpm x5min
- aspiration
- resuspend with 40mL 293T medium
- apply all to T75
- after confirmation with a microscope, transfer to the incubator
- culture for 5 days (approx.)

### Immunofluorescense
#### day1
- prepare `adherent 24-well dish for observation`
- aspirate fibro. in the wells
- apply 293T medium 500uL each
- after pipetting for several times, transfer culturing suspension 200uL each from T25 into wells
- 37°C incubation o/n

#### day2
- confirm with microscope that 293T firmly adhere to the floor
- aspiration
- process with PFA x45min (approx.) in RT
- PBS wash x4
- process with 0.3% TX x5min (approx.) in RT
- PBS wash x2
- apply Primary Ab Mix
    - e.g.) Primary Ab Mix (for 1 well)
